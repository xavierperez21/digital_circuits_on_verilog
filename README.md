# digital_circuits_on_verilog
Development of a 4 Bits Adder with Carry Lookahead, a 4 bit up-down counter, a 4 bits Shift Register, and other projects using Verilog.

These projects were developed thanks to the course "Introducci√≥n al desarrollo de hardware con Verilog" by GalileoX in edX plattform.
